A.R.M.S - A Race for Munitions and Survival

Game Concepts

1. Main Mode- Survival

- In this game mode, players play as robots and they must gain as many weapons as possible using them to attack and destroy all the opponents.
Last survivor wins, death -> elimination
>Specs:
Player Energy: 100 Volts
Player Shield: Starts at 0 Volts, charges by attacking with a weapon that uses energy or drawing shields.
You can gain shield by selling cards (energy worth is shown on the card)

You can use the crystal to destroy all upgrades on an opponents weapon, but it will consume the crystal
