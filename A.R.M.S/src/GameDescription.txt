A.R.M.S - A Race for Munitions and Survival

Game Concepts

1. Main Mode- Survival

- In this game mode, players play as robots and they must gain as many weapons as possible using them to attack and destroy all the opponents.
Last survivor wins, death -> elimination
>Specs:
Player Energy: 100 Volts
Player Shield: Starts at 0 Volts, charges by attacking with a weapon that uses energy or drawing shields.
You can gain shield by selling cards (energy worth is shown on the card)

>Weapon Upgrades: You can add an energy crystal to a completed weapon, changing the weapon to its crystal form
You can use the crystal to destroy all upgrades on an opponents weapon, but it will consume the crystal
