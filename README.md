#A.R.M.S
##Mode- Survival
In this game mode, players play as robots and they must gain as many weapons as possible using them to attack and destroy all the opponents. Last survivor wins, death -> elimination

##Specs:
Player Energy: 100 Volts
Player Shield: Starts at 0 Volts, charges by attacking with a weapon that uses energy or drawing shields.
You can gain shield by selling cards (energy worth is shown on the card)

##Gameplay:

One player goes at a time, based on their ordering. In one turn a player gets 3 moves.
At the beginning of their turn, players draw two cards, then can play three cards

Each turn, player can  
a) play a card  
b) discard a card  
c) end turn  

At the end of each turn, players can have up to 7 cards in their hand. Or else, the turn cannot be ended.  
Discarding cards at this point does not take a turn.

##Win Conditions:

When all other players are dead, winner will gain X amount of points, others will gain points based on performance
Games are matched based on ranking

##Weapons:

###Weapon Concepts:
######Accuracy: 
(Increased by range, sights, etc.)
Weapons start out with a base "accuracy", and the chance that the weapon will hit is based on this accuracy.

######Damage: 
(Increased by rate of fire, power upgrades, etc.)
Weapons start out with a base damage, and energy/shield this takes away is based on this damage.

######Vampiric:
(Some upgrades make things vampiric, energy crystals always do)
Weapons can be vampiric, which means that they absorb shields or energy to the player who attacks.

###Energy Crystal:  
You can add an energy crystal to a completed weapon, changing the weapon to its crystal form  
You can use the crystal to destroy all upgrades on an opponents weapon, but it will consume the crystal
