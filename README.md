# A.R.M.S.
Short for "A Race for Munitions and Survival", this is a fast-paced battle race to who can obtain the required weapon sets or shoot down all his/her opponents. This is used with a old fashioned cards user interface, but still pretty cool (currently in development)! This idea has been inspired by Hasbro's Monopoly Deal Cards.
